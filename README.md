# Coding-Raja-Technologies-Internship
Program using python to develop a console-based budget tracker that allows users to manage their expenses and income which has the features:Expense and Income Entry, Budget Calculation, Expense Analysis, Data Persistence

# Personal Budget Tracker

The goal of this project is create a Python app that lets you (as a user) track and categorize your monthly expenses and help you budget.

The app will let users type their expense category and amount directly into the terminal. It'll then save (append) that expense entry to a file. And finally, read the file to summarise the expense totals for that month.

It'll also tell the user how much they can spend for the rest of the month to stay in budget (which is a custom value decided by your app, e.g. Rs.2000.

It also tells us the spending trends and the Insights about the budget.

## ðŸŽ¯ App Requirements

1. Ask the user to add an expense (name, category, amount)
2. Save expense entries to a .csv file.
3. Read the file to summarise the expense totals for that month
4. Show the user remaining budget that they can spend for the rest of the month (to stay in budget).
5. Plots a graph between Categories and amount spent the spending trends.
6. It also provides the insights

## ðŸ’¡ Recommended Project Structure

This project will be consisting of 2 files:

1. expense.py: A class for creating and storing expense objects.
2. expense_tracker.py: The main application logic.

## âœ… Tasks

1. Create the expense.py class.
2. Create the expense_tracker.py file and write the main logic for the app.
3. Run the app to test it.
